/**
 * Waits until the page's map has the layers an overlay was just given.
 *
 * Longdo is a page in a WebView: `LongdoMap.run` queues the script and returns,
 * and an add that finds the style not ready retries from the page with
 * `setTimeout`.
 * So a renderer's `onAdd` returned before its layers were on the map, and
 * the overlay's `onAdded` (asked for right after the hand-over) came while
 * the map still showed nothing. Boston's 604 downtown polygons reported
 * `onAdded` 0.1 s after the hand-over; the last of their layers reached the
 * map 1.4 s after it (Lenovo TB520FU).
 * Renderers call [await] at the end of `onAdd`, so `compositionXxx`
 * returns, and `onAdded` is called, once the layers are there.
 *
 * Only that the layers are in the style is waited for, not their tiles or
 * images (same as every other provider).
